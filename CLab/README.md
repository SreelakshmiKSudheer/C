# C Lab Workouts
## Cycle 1
    1. Find the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. (if .. else)
    2. Input a month number and display the number of days in that month. (switch)
    3. Find the GCD and LCM of two numbers. (while / do ..while)
    4. Find the largest and smallest of a set of N numbers. (for)
    5. Input a binary number and display the decimal equivalent of that number. (while /do .. while)
    6. Display the first N prime numbers. ( nested loop)
    7. Display the perfect numbers in first N counting numbers. ( nested loop)
## Cycle 2
    8. Search for a particular number in a list of N numbers using linear search. Display the position of the number in the list if the number is present. Otherwise display suitable message.
    9. Display the binary equivalent of an unsigned decimal integer. (using 1-D array)
    10. Sort N integers in ascending order using bubble sort algorithm.
    11. Search for a number in a sorted list of numbers using binary search. 
    12. Given two sets (mathematical set) of numbers A and B. Find A U B, A ∩B, A-B.
    13. Given two sorted list of numbers. Merge these two lists to form a new list such that 
    the resultant list is also in sorted order. (do the operation without further sorting).
## Cycle 3
    14. Find the smallest element in a m x n matrix. Also display the position of this smallest element. {Position of the first occurrence of smallest element in the matrix}
    15. Find the sum of elements in each row, each column of a m x n matrix. Also find the sum of boundary elements the matrix.
    16. Check whether a given square matrix is symmetric. If not symmetric display the transpose of the matrix.
    17. Find the alphabet which is occurring highest number of times in a line of text. Alsodisplay its frequency.
    18. Input N student names and arrange them in alphabetical order using exchange sort.
## Cycle 4
    19. Write a function for checking whether a positive integer number is prime or not. Using this function display the prime numbers in a mxn matrix.
    20. Write functions for evaluating sine(ɵ) and cosine(ɵ). Verify the values using library functions sin(ɵ) and cos(ɵ). {Convert degree into radians}
    21. Write a recursive function for finding factorial. Using this function find nCr.
    22. Write a function for checking whether a string is palindrome. Using this function display the palindrome words in a line of text.
    23. Write a recursive function for binary search. Using this function check whether a number is present in a list of numbers arranged in descending order.
    24. Write a program for finding the product of two matrices. Write separate functions for Reading matrices, Multiplication of matrices and Display matrix.
    25. Write a function for finding the largest number in a one dimensional array. Using this function display the largest element in each row of a mxn matrix.
## Cycle 5
    26.Store the regno, name and 4 marks of a set of students in an array of structure and display the details along with total marks in the descending order of total marks.
